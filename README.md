### Introduction
Hello, my name is Shaheem. I'm a web developer from Kerala, India, with a focus on backend development. I have 1.6 years of experience, primarily working with the Django Framework. I'm skilled in both backend and front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. My main projects involve developing efficient Content Management Systems.

### Experience
In my 1.6 years of working, I've been part of a startup that developed a system now used by over 20,000 people in cities like Kochi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai. I've worked on improving dashboard processes, which helped increase our team's productivity by 40%.

### Educational Background
I graduated from the Safi Institute of Advanced Study in Malappuram, Kerala, with a degree from Calicut University. I achieved a CGPA of 6.2. My studies covered Python Programming, Web Development, Database Management Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Networking.

During my college years, I was active in tech communities, including the TinkerHub Foundation and the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador program. I also co-founded a tech community at my college and volunteered with Pygrammers, a Python community. Besides my work, I enjoy learning about iOS Application Development in my free time.

### Community Engagement
I believe in the importance of giving back to the community. I'm helping Al-Hudha Orphanage in Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, with their digital transition. I'm creating a sophisticated dashboard to digitize over 25 years of student data. This system will improve staff productivity, making it easier to connect sponsors with students, manage new admissions, and track student expenses.
